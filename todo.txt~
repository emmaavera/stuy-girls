Hi Mary!

Okay so here is what we need to have done for Dennis by Monday (because from Meet's lack of response I'm going to asuume that you're still meeting then)

1. Translate Salman's java code into python; I'll try to work on this but it shouldn't be too hard.  We're going to need to implement objects in python which is a bit of a hassle, but it shouldn't be too difficult.  
2. We need to write a genetic algorithm to control strand generation.

In the test file there are some comments about errors with array shifting which should be really easy to fix b/c it looks like Salman just doesn't control for the array length very well.
On a second glance, the tester file is just subpar and unfinished.

Focus in translating Strand.java b/c it has most of the operations that we'll need for our genalg.

I'll upload a strat for the genalg soon!

Soon:
- genetic representation of the solution domain
- fitness function
