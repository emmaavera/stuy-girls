Hi Mary!

Okay so here is what we need to have done for Dennis by Monday (because from Meet's lack of response I'm going to asuume that you're still meeting then)

1. Translate Salman's java code into python; I'll try to work on this but it shouldn't be too hard.  We're going to need to implement objects in python which is a bit of a hassle, but it shouldn't be too difficult.  
2. We need to write a genetic algorithm to control strand generation.
